# Introduction:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. In this particular project, we are tasked with analyzing tweets from Twitter to determine whether they are related to real disasters or not.

Twitter has become a crucial communication channel during emergencies, allowing people to share information about ongoing disasters in real-time. However, it can be challenging to determine whether a tweet is genuinely describing a disaster or if it's unrelated or metaphorical.

Our goal is to develop a machine learning model using NLP techniques to predict whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not. To achieve this, we'll leverage a dataset of tweets that have been hand-classified as either related to disasters or not.

In this project, we'll follow these main steps:

- Data Exploration: We'll start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and content, including features like the tweet text and the target label indicating whether it's a real disaster tweet or not.

- Data Preprocessing: We'll preprocess the text data by removing noise, such as special characters and stopwords, and converting the text into a format suitable for machine learning models.

- Feature Engineering: We'll extract features from the text data using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which represents the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.

- Model Training: We'll train a machine learning model, specifically a Logistic Regression model, using the preprocessed text data and the extracted features.

- Model Evaluation: We'll evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as F1-score, which considers both precision and recall.

- Generating Predictions: Finally, we'll use the trained model to predict whether new tweets from a test dataset are related to real disasters or not.

By the end of this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying tweets discussing real disasters, thereby assisting disaster relief organizations and news agencies in monitoring and responding to emergencies more effectively.

# Conclusion 

In conclusion, this project aimed to address the challenge of classifying tweets into two categories: real disaster tweets and non-disaster tweets. We utilized a logistic regression model for this task.

First, we explored the dataset, which consisted of tweets labeled with their corresponding target categories. We then preprocessed the text data, converting it into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.

Next, we split the data into training and validation sets, and trained the logistic regression model on the training data. We evaluated the model's performance using the F1 score metric on the validation set, achieving a score of approximately 0.7423.

Finally, we applied the trained model to predict the target labels for the test dataset and generated a submission file for evaluation.

In summary, this project demonstrated the application of natural language processing techniques and logistic regression modeling for tweet classification, providing insights into the potential use of machine learning for disaster detection on social media platforms.
